		    mor1kx development platform
		    ===========================

This project is a fork of ORPSoCv2 and is intended to be used to help develop
and verify the mor1kx processor.

The reasons why this is forked from ORPSoCv2 are:

* things are very mor1kx-specific
* maintaing the cycle accurate build in such a way that it can easily support
  either the or1200 or mor1kx is rather hard and I'd rather focus on the mor1kx
  * We really do need Verilator support becuase it's used for linting and for
    verification, when we run the GCC regression suite on the generated model.

Setup
=====

To set up the project, please symbolically link in the mor1kx git repo directory
to rtl/verilog.

Eg.
	cd rtl/verilog
	ln -s ~/path/to/git/mor1kx/rtl/verilog mor1kx

This helps hacking on the mor1kx as well as the verification environment (we 
don't want to check the mor1kx code into this environment).

Then, symlink the two required include files to the include/ directory of
the generic mor1kx build, and wherever else you need it:

    	cd boards/generic/mor1kx/rtl/verilog/include
	ln -s ../../../../../../rtl/verilog/mor1kx/mor1kx-defines.v
	ln -s ../../../../../../rtl/verilog/mor1kx/mor1kx-sprs.v

To get the verilated model running, the path to a compiled libor1kktrace
(available from git://github.com/juliusbaxter/or1ktrace.git)
needs to be symlinked in:
	ln -s /path/to/libor1ktrace or1ktrace

Words of Wisdom
===============


git doesn't like empty directories and makes them disappear when committing.

To get things to work in the generic/mor1kx build you'll need to add the out/
and modules/ directories as follows:

        mkdir boards/generic/mor1kx/modules
        mkdir boards/generic/mor1kx/sim/out


Building the verilated model
============================

In boards/generic/mor1kx/sim/run do:

   make prepare-vlt USER_VLT_FLAGS="-Wno-WIDTH"

Add V=1 if you wish to have all of the build output.

This first lints the design and then generates the C++ model and compiles it up
into a nice fast cycle-accurate simulator.
