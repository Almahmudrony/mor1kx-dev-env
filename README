Hi, I see you're interested in mor1kx development. Great choice!

However this particular project isn't the best thing to look at anymore, as it's unmaintained, but keep reading...

There are other projects and sources of information on getting up and running with the mor1kx core which are better maintained and up to date. I'll aim to curate a list of these resources below:

* https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx/wiki/Setting-up-a-mor1kx-development-and-verification-environment
* http://wiki.mintsoc.org/doku.php?id=openrisc_tutorial
